How it works.
The application has 2 principal components: Search Engine & Instant Messenger. The search engine criteria are service description, location and availability. When a user gets back search results, he or she can immediately contact providers through a messenger link. No phone number required. The search engine ranks providers by skills, reviews, response rate / time and availability.

Revenue.
The revenue is generated through a number of ways. The first one is a time management help to a small business professional. Creating job routes, coordinating with customers & etc. The second is a search results side parking. Example: Google search paid ads at the page top.

The current development stage.
The application technical part is above 90% complete. At this stage we are looking for angel investors.
